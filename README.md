# Shakespere Neural Network 

This is a simple neural network that trains on Shakespeare's poems and plays to try and replicate his unique writing style. It's a fun project that uses AI to generate text that sounds like it could have been written by the man himself.

## What The Project Does 
- Trains on Shakespeare's Texts: The neural network learns from a dataset of Shakespeare's poems and plays.
- Generates New Text: After training, the network can generate new text that mimics Shakespeare's style.

## Enjoy
Feel free to play around with the code, train the model on different texts, and see what kind of Shakespearean poetry you can create!
